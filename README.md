Inappropriate developmental exposure to steroids is linked to metabolic disorders. Prenatal testosterone excess or bisphenol A (BPA, an environmental estrogen mimic) leads to insulin resistance and adipocyte disruptions in female. Adipocytes are key regulators of insulin sensitivity and tissue-specific differences in insulin sensitivity, coupled with adipose depot-specific changes in key mRNAs, were previously observed. We hypothesized that depot-specific changes in the non-coding RNA (ncRNA) regulators of gene expression would prevail to account for the direction of changes seen in mRNAs. Noncoding RNA (lncRNA, miRNA, snoRNA, snRNA) from various adipose depots of prenatal testosterone and BPA-treated animals were sequenced. Adipose depot-specific changes in the ncRNA that are consistent with the depot-specific mRNA expression in terms of directionality of changes and functional implications in insulin resistance, adipocyte differentiation and cardiac hypertrophy were found. Importantly, the adipose depot-specific ncRNA changes were model-specific that were mutually exclusive suggestive of different regulatory entry points in this regulation.
